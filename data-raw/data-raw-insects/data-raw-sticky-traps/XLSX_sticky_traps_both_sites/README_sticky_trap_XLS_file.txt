Sampling described as 
"Food resources. Assessment of potential food items was focused on insect abundance as we sought to explain the distribution, 
in particular, of over-wintering migratory birds. Insects were sampled in December, January and February of years 1 and 2 with 
five yellow sticky traps placed at breast height for 48 hrs along a transect in each habitat. All insects 0.1–5.0 mm length 
were counted and pooled across sampling periods; the few larger insects were excluded because most wintering migrants consume 
primarily small arthropods (Greenberg 1995; Poulin and Lefebvre 1996). "
