Original email from Steve Latta on 12/12/17 regarding the 7 source files for the Mencia pasture succesion project

"Here are the Mencia raw data; one file for each year, plus the Aceitillar data (mature dry forest) for comparison. 

The Aceitillar file contains info on site persistence, which you will need. 
For the Mencia data, site persistence of those birds is contained in the All Mencia B file.
Let me know if you don’t understand something or if I can help.


Before you do any analyses you should generate a list of species/species codes; some may be entered incorrectly 
or I may have changed the code I used, so I would want to double check those."
