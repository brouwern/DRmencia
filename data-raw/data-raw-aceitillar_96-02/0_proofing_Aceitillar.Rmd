## Data provenence and background

### Original spreadsheet 
* Original spreadsheet from SL "Aceitllar 96-02.xls"
* 3 worksheets 
  + Returned migr (583 rows)
  + Site persistent migr (690 rows)
  + All caps (1094 rows; "W" code in "comments" column)
  
Note: 583+690 = 1273, not 1094

### Data dictionary

C: bird 1st captured and banded. I
W: not resighted (S) in orig capture period, and then never seen or captured again.  If it was S or C after initial C, then it is not a W.

SP = site persistent, and are birds that remain in the area for some part of the winter.

"Annual return birds"" are any SP birds that return the following winter.
